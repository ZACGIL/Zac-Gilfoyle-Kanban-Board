# Zac-Gilfoyle-Kanban-Board
Hi!

My name is Zac Gilfoyle.

## Description
This repository contains files for a Kanban Board. On this website you can enter task information into a form, that will then be displayed on a task board which allow you to organize the tasks across various lists through jQuery.
This is then stored locally and is restored upon refresh or moving between pages. 

Along with this the page will contain some functionalities for date picking with Day.JS.

This website is a demonstration of knowledge for third party API's.

Below is an image and link of the kanban board which you will be able to sort into a list and drag to other lists.
